# INF-3910-5

https://uit.no/utdanning/emner/emne/696340/inf-3910-5

Applied functional programming course taught at Department of Informatics, UiT
The Arctic University of Norway.

The Monday's lectures will be devoted to more theoretical aspects of functional
programming. The lectures on Wednesday and Thursday will be of a more practical
nature, focusing on application in F#.

The primary programming environment used during the course will be:

* F# 5.0
* .NET 5
* Visual Studio Code
* Fable 3 
  * Elmish
  * Feliz

# F# resources

* https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com 
  One of the best learning resource for functional programming and F#. Plenty of tutorials, videos, articles and more. A real treasure trove.
* https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book
  A valuable resource on modern web programming in F#, by the author of the Feliz library suite (and many more libraries).
