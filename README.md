# INF-3910-5

Applied functional programming course taught at Department of Informatics, UiT
The Arctic University of Norway.

The Monday's lectures will be devoted to more theoretical aspects of functional
programming. The lectures on Wednesday and Thursday will be of a more practical
nature, focusing on application in F#.

The primary programming environment used during the course will be:

* F# 4.5
* .NET Core 2.2
* Visual Studio Code
* Fable 2.1 and Elmish
* Paket
